# Gunther's Grotto _(coursework version)_
This is the original Gunther's Grotto game which I made for my A Level Computer Science coursework.

## I'm working on a remake!
The scope of this game was sadly greatly limited, with it being for a school assignment, however I continue to have big ideas for it. And so, I'm currently working on a Gunther's Grotto remake that I hope to put more time and effort into as a personal project.

My goal is to reach a stable release by the **end of 2024** (or earlier, depending on how it goes). I plan to push my more ambitious ideas into updates that follow, to ensure that I get the game released.

### Where can I find it?
